Kickstarter Data Analysis

## Introduction

We anaylze a sample[link] dataset of 1000 Kickstarter projects from 2010 to 2020 for any insights into what makes for a successfully or failed entry. Overall the dataset consist of 579 successfully (funded or went live) projects, and 364 which failed to get funded. A small number (57) of the projects were also cancelled.

## Discussion

The three main Kickstarter categories for all countries are Film and Video, Music, and Theater, with Theater being the most popular. Overall more than half the projects in those categories are successful aside from Games which have a success rate of about 40%. However, the country the project is based in, seems to play a role. For example, when we look at the music sub categories, Rock music projects are successful in most countries except in few where they fail.  As such, the key takeaway is that based on the particular country, make sure to choose projects in certain categories/sub-categories to improve the odds of being successfully funded.  That said, a larger more balanced dataset is needed to really flesh that hypothesis out.  

In addition to categories, the time of the year a project goes live seems to play a role. Projects which go live between June and September appear to have a slightly greater chance of being funded, than the other times of the year.  Again, a larger dataset is needed to really see if there is any statistical significance to these.

When the success vs funded goal is analyzed, projects between $1,000 - $5,000 have a higher chance of success vs other categories it seems.  However, it should be noted that projects with goals between $10,000 - $50,000 do seem to have a higher funded percentage, but there are simply not enough of these records in the dataset to draw any conclusion from.   

Finally looking at the number of backers for successful vs failed projects, it's no surprise successful projects have a greater number of backers. When we look at the median number of backers, successful projects have about twice as many backers, and a greater variance.  Somewhat surprising is that when we look at the average number of backers of both successful and failed campaigns there difference is about 57% vs 43% which means that there are a few outlier projects with a large number of backers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a few conclusions can be drawn from the current dataset, however a larger more balanced dataset would be needed to elucidate further insights. That said, project owners should really focus their kickstarter campaigns on selecting the right time to go live, asking for between $1,000 to $5,000, and ofcourse attracting a greater number of backers.
